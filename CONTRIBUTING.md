## Submitting a pull request

1. Fork and clone the repository.
1. Configure and install the dependencies.
1. Make sure the tests pass on your machine.
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`.
1. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass.
1. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
1. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

### Use work-in-progress PRs for early feedback
A good way to communicate before investing too much time is to create a "Work-in-progress" PR and share it with your reviewers. The standard way of doing this is to add a "[WIP]" prefix in your PR's title and assign the do-not-merge label. This will let people looking at your PR know that it is not well baked yet.
